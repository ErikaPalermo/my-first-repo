# My First Project
## About
> This project is to teach us about Git and Github basics that we will soon apply for our future projects.
## Installation
To install a repository from GitHub, you first need to make sure that Git is installed on your computer. After that, open your terminal and go to the folder where you want the project to be saved. Copy the repository link from GitHub by clicking the Code button and selecting the HTTPS link, then type git clone followed by the copied link and press Enter. Git will download the repository and create a folder with the project files on your computer. Once it finishes, you can open the folder and start using or editing the project.
## Usage
To use a project from GitHub, you first need to download it to your computer by cloning the repository using Git. After the project is saved on your system, open the project folder and read the **README.md** file because it usually explains what the project does and how to run it. Next, install any required dependencies or tools mentioned in the instructions, such as libraries or packages. Once everything is set up, follow the given commands to run the project, test it, or make changes. After that, you can use the project as intended or modify the code based on your needs.
